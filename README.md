# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
## About
I am Nawaporn, I graduated with a First-Class Honours degree in English. During my first role as a contractor data management system coordinator, I discovered a passion for data analysis. This experience involved extensive data handling, including cleaning, troubleshooting, and generating daily, weekly, and monthly reports. To further develop my skills, I pursued online courses from Google Data Analytics and Datarockie Data Science Bootcamp. These courses have equipped me with a strong foundation in data analysis and a keen interest in using data to extract valuable insights. I am enthusiastic about applying my technical and analytical abilities to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

Independent learning further strengthened my ability to handle complex data sets. This period also fostered a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. Additionally, I expanded my knowledge in machine learning, data management, and statistical analysis, all of which will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

My commitment to continuous learning is evident in my dedication to exploring new data analysis tools and techniques during my free time. I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skillset. Whether working collaboratively or independently, I am motivated by the challenge of uncovering new insights and the gratification of leveraging data to solve complex problems.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

## SQL
### Covid-19 Data Exploration
**Code**: [Covid-19 project](https://github.com/eyenawaporn/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Covid19_Project.sql)  
          [Tableau visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nawaporn.pernmankhong/viz/CovidDashboard2020-2024_17110964524360/Dashboard1)  

**Goal**: To clean data, analyze data, and create a compelling data visualization on Tableau.  

**Description**: This dataset has information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccines for different countries from 2020 to 2024. The project involves getting the data, cleaning it up, and then digging into it to see what's going on (Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA for short)  

**Skill**: Joins, CTE's, Basic functions, Aggregate functions, Creating views, Converting data types, and Visualization   

**Tool**: Bigquery and Tableau  

### Student Performance Data Exploration  
**Code**: [Student performance project](https://github.com/eyenawaporn/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Student%20Performance.sql)  

**Goal**: To explore data using EDA method.  

**Description**: This project entails data acquisition, cleansing, and exploration (Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA) to uncover patterns. SQL statements and subqueries will be employed to facilitate this in-depth analysis.  

**Skill**: Basic SQL statements, subqueries  

**Tool**: SQLite    

## R programming language
### Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study
**Code**: [Cyclistic bike-share](https://github.com/eyenawaporn/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Cyslistic%20project.R)  

**Goal**:  To design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.  

**Description**: Pretending I'm a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compeling data insights and professional data visualizations.  

**Skill**: Ask right question, Prepare data, Clean data, Analyze data, Visualize data, and Suggesting a recommendation  

**Tool**: R programming language: library(ggplot2) for visualization  

**Result**: Our data visualization reveals distinct usage patterns between casual riders and members.  Membership data suggests a strong correlation with commuting, evidenced by peak usage during morning and evening rush hours. Conversely, casual ridership exhibits a seasonal trend, concentrated during the summer months (June-August).  Based on this analysis, a targeted marketing campaign aimed at non-member office workers and summer casual riders is recommended.  This campaign could leverage free trials and discount offers to incentivize membership subscriptions.

### Creating Chatbot to Take Customers' Orders  
**Code**: [Chatbot order pizza](https://github.com/eyenawaporn/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Chatbot%20order%20pizza.ipynb)

**Description**:  Pretending I'm a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The
insights I discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. I will present my analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with my high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.  

**Skill**: Ask right question, Prepare data, Clean data, Analyze data, Visualize data, and Suggesting a recommendation  

**Tool**: Python: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib    

**Result**: Bellabeat has the opportunity to broaden user perception beyond sports and exercise-related activities. Data suggests that many users wear the tracker more frequently on weekends, potentially indicating an association with solely physical pursuits or leisurely weekend walks. Bellabeat can effectively communicate the value proposition of its products as companions for all daily activities, including work. This comprehensive approach to health and fitness tracking empowers women of diverse demographics and backgrounds to prioritize their well-being, ultimately expanding Bellabeat's reach to all women seeking holistic health improvement.
