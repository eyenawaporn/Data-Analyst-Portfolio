# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
## About
I am Nawaporn, I graduated with a First-Class Honours degree in English. During my first role as a contractor data management system coordinator, I discovered a passion for data analysis. This experience involved extensive data handling, including cleaning, troubleshooting, and generating daily, weekly, and monthly reports. To further develop my skills, I pursued online courses from Google Data Analytics and Datarockie Data Science Bootcamp. These courses have equipped me with a strong foundation in data analysis and a keen interest in using data to extract valuable insights. I am enthusiastic about applying my technical and analytical abilities to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

Independent learning further strengthened my ability to handle complex data sets. This period also fostered a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. Additionally, I expanded my knowledge in machine learning, data management, and statistical analysis, all of which will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

My commitment to continuous learning is evident in my dedication to exploring new data analysis tools and techniques during my free time. I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skillset. Whether working collaboratively or independently, I am motivated by the challenge of uncovering new insights and the gratification of leveraging data to solve complex problems.

### Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study
**Link**: [Cyclistic bike-share](https://github.com/eyenawaporn/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Cyslistic%20project.R)  

**Goal**:  To design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.  

**Description**: Pretending I'm a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compeling data insights and professional data visualizations.  

**Skill**: Ask right question, Prepare data, Clean data, Analyze data, Visualize data, and Suggesting a recommendation  

**Tool**: R programming language: library(ggplot2) for visualization  

**Result**: Our data visualization reveals distinct usage patterns between casual riders and members.  Membership data suggests a strong correlation with commuting, evidenced by peak usage during morning and evening rush hours. Conversely, casual ridership exhibits a seasonal trend, concentrated during the summer months (June-August).  Based on this analysis, a targeted marketing campaign aimed at non-member office workers and summer casual riders is recommended.  This campaign could leverage free trials and discount offers to incentivize membership subscriptions.
