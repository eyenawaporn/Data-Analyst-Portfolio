# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
## About
I am Nawaporn, a recent graduate with a First-Class Honours degree in English. During my first role as a contractor data management system coordinator, I discovered a passion for data analysis. This experience involved extensive data handling, including cleaning, troubleshooting, and generating daily, weekly, and monthly reports. To further develop my skills, I pursued online courses from Google Data Analytics and Datarockie Data Science Bootcamp. These courses have equipped me with a strong foundation in data analysis and a keen interest in using data to extract valuable insights. I am enthusiastic about applying my technical and analytical abilities to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

Independent learning further strengthened my ability to handle complex data sets. This period also fostered a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. Additionally, I expanded my knowledge in machine learning, data management, and statistical analysis, all of which will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

My commitment to continuous learning is evident in my dedication to exploring new data analysis tools and techniques during my free time. I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skillset. Whether working collaboratively or independently, I am motivated by the challenge of uncovering new insights and the gratification of leveraging data to solve complex problems.

### Covid-19 data exploration
**Link**: [Covid-19 project](https://github.com/eyenawaporn/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Covid19_Project.sql)  
          [Tableau visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nawaporn.pernmankhong/viz/CovidDashboard2020-2024_17110964524360/Dashboard1)  

**Goal**: To clean data, analyze data, and create a compelling data visualization on Tableau.  

**Description**: This data set has info on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccines for different countries from 2020 to 2024. The project involves getting the data, cleaning it up, and then digging into it to see what's going on (Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA for short)  

**Skill**: Joins, CTE's, Basic functions, Aggregate functions, Creating views, Converting data types, and Visualization   

**Tool** Bigquery and Tableau  

**Result** Find interesting insights from this dataset such as percentage of people who got infected per population, country with the highest infection rate, and death rate.  


### R programming language
### Creating chatbot to order pizza
**Link**: [Chatbot order pizza](https://github.com/eyenawaporn/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Chatbot%20order%20pizza.ipynb)  

**Goal**: To create chatbot for user to order pizza  

**Description**: I used R to create chatbot which it'll ask user name, show the menu, ask what user would like to order, and calculate the price. I used function readline() to ask for user input. 

**Skill**: R programming language: flush.console(), readline(), control flow  

**Tool**: R programming language  

**Result**: Successfully creating chatbot for user to order pizza.  

### Creating rock paper scissors game
**Link**: [Rock paper scissors game using R](https://github.com/eyenawaporn/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/rock_paper_scissors_R.ipynb)  

**Goal**: To create function for user to play rock paper scissors game with bot.  

**Description**: This game has been programmed using functions to facilitate user interaction with the computer. Players are granted three attempts per round. After each attempt, the score is automatically calculated and displayed upon completion of the three rounds. The game mechanics incorporate a randomization function to determine the computer's move, allowing for potential wins, losses, or draws.  

**Skill**: R programming language: flush.console(), readline(), control flow  

**Tool**: R programming language  

**Result**: Successfully creating rock paper scissors game function for user to play with computer.  

### Write table into server
**Link**: [Write table into server](https://github.com/eyenawaporn/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/write_dataframe_to_server.R)  

**Goal**: To create 3 dataframe and write table into server.  

**Description**: I used table that I created in pizza restautant and write these tables into PostgreSQL by using library RPostgreSQL and tidyverse.

### Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study
**Link**: [Cyclistic bike-share](https://github.com/eyenawaporn/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Cyslistic%20project.R)  

**Goal**:  To design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.  

**Description**: Pretending I'm a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compeling data insights and professional data visualizations.  

**Skill**: Ask right question, Prepare data, Clean data, Analyze data, Visualize data, and Suggesting a recommendation  

**Tool**: R programming language: library(ggplot2) for visualization  

**Result**: Our data visualization reveals distinct usage patterns between casual riders and members.  Membership data suggests a strong correlation with commuting, evidenced by peak usage during morning and evening rush hours. Conversely, casual ridership exhibits a seasonal trend, concentrated during the summer months (June-August).  Based on this analysis, a targeted marketing campaign aimed at non-member office workers and summer casual riders is recommended.  This campaign could leverage free trials and discount offers to incentivize membership subscriptions.
